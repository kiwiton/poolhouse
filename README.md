# 	poolhouse
messuring things and viualising them via lorawan technology 
# 	components
In this projec I make use of 
	an arduino uno with an lora shield,
	a rasberryPi4 with a lora/gps hat,
	dht11 sensor,
	ldr,
	some LED's and resistors(4x 220& 1x10k), 
	a ventilator,
	a MOSfet IRF510, 
	and a button,

# 	rasberryPi

We're using our Pi as gateway to the TTN so we can integrate with cayenne.

First let's start with enabeling spi on youre Pi. type in youre CLI: "sudo raspi-config" select the 5th option interfacing options.

Second select option 4 "SPI"
![alt text](https://github.com/kiwiton/poolhouse/blob/readmeEdits/pics/selectOption4.png)
After that choose "yes" and press enter and select "ok", now press the right arrow key and enter to finish in this menu an go back to your CLI.

Next up, installing wiringpi:
In the CLI enter "sudo apt-get install wiringpi"

Now downloadind the single channel paket forwarder by entering the following in the CLI:
"Sudo https://github.com/tftelkamp/single_chan_pkt_fwd/archive/master.zip"

This will download a ".zip3 file, we're going to unzip it by typing "unzip master.zip" in the CLI.

After that you need to change the verver address in the main.cpp file. first let's go there 
![alt text](https://github.com/kiwiton/poolhouse/blob/readmeEdits/pics/cdToDir.png)

Enter: "sudo nano main.cpp" in the command line to enter this file and change the server address to the according servername of your continent.

Afterwards we make this file to compile it.

And run it![alt text](https://github.com/kiwiton/poolhouse/blob/readmeEdits/pics/runtTheForwarder.png)

in my case the gateway address signed to me was: dc a6 32 ff ff 60 5b 49 .

# TTN

Now its time to make a TTN acount and go to gateways. And add a gateway by cklicking on register gateway

![alt text](https://github.com/kiwiton/poolhouse/blob/readmeEdits/pics/GWoverview.png)

Enter your gateway ID in the name field and tick off the box that says: “i’m using the legacy packet forwarder” 

![alt text](https://github.com/kiwiton/poolhouse/blob/readmeEdits/pics/registerAGW.png)
 
Further look for the frequency plan you continent follows and select that, description aint needed but always handy.
The router should be picked for you automaticly. Press the green Register gateway button under on the right side

# making the breadboard

![alt text](https://github.com/kiwiton/poolhouse/blob/readmeEdits/pics/breadboardSchemaPoolhouse.png)

Next up you should connect all the components like in the picture above. There are a few caviats to it though.
First up I used an DHT11 instead of an RHT11 but my program to draw the schematics didn't allow for the DHT11 model to be used.
also you notice that the motor is connected to a random breadboard pin. Because the ventilator I have works On 12V but I don't have a 12V DC source so far for that.
In the code Included all the code necesary to get the ventilator running as it should.

In the folder /pics you can find the electric schematic for this project

So if you upload the code from LoraTesting.ino onto the aduino with Lora shield you should set up the application side of things.


# TTN aplication
So go to the TTN console an select applications and click on add application

![alt text](https://github.com/kiwiton/poolhouse/blob/readmeEdits/pics/addApp.png)

give your app a name you like. A description aint needed but sometimes handy. take the responseble handler and,
Application EUI will be generated by TTN itself. And press the green button add application.

![alt text](https://github.com/kiwiton/poolhouse/blob/readmeEdits/pics/appOverview.png)

the application is now created select it. register a device by clicking register a device

![alt text](https://github.com/kiwiton/poolhouse/blob/readmeEdits/pics/appOverviewWithDev.png)

Register your device by giving it a name the rest I let TTN generate for me and press register. 
![alt text](https://github.com/kiwiton/poolhouse/blob/readmeEdits/pics/registerDev.png)

aµAfterwards go to settings to change the activation method from OTAA to ABP
![alt text](https://github.com/kiwiton/poolhouse/blob/readmeEdits/pics/appliSettings.png)

In the picture below are the the things you need to replace in the code with your own address and keys 
![alt text](https://github.com/kiwiton/poolhouse/blob/readmeEdits/pics/copyToCode.png)

right now it should be able to recieve data

# integration
To integrate this project into cayenne you go to application overview and go to the integrations tab

![alt text](https://github.com/kiwiton/poolhouse/blob/readmeEdits/pics/integrTab.png)

And press add integrattion

![alt text](https://github.com/kiwiton/poolhouse/blob/readmeEdits/pics/addIntergration.png)

Scroll down a little and pick the myDevices option.
![alt text](https://github.com/kiwiton/poolhouse/blob/readmeEdits/pics/mydevice.png)

![alt text](https://github.com/kiwiton/poolhouse/blob/readmeEdits/pics/mydevicetab.png)

Give it a process ID you like and take the default key as acces key.

Go to ceyenne and create an account. Add a new device

![alt text](https://github.com/kiwiton/poolhouse/blob/readmeEdits/pics/cayenneAddDevice.png)

select this symbol in the Lora subcategory
![alt text](https://github.com/kiwiton/poolhouse/blob/readmeEdits/pics/TTNSymbol.png)

scroll down a bit til you see: Dragino Technology GPS Shield, select it

![alt text](https://github.com/kiwiton/poolhouse/blob/readmeEdits/pics/shield.png)

enter your device-EUI and press add device

![alt text](https://github.com/kiwiton/poolhouse/blob/readmeEdits/pics/addingArduino.png)

the integration should look like this
